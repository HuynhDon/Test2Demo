Description:
  For this test I learned the basics of how github can be used along with an IDE (Eclipse). In this test I had to create a repository and create issues for said project and I had to fix those issues. I did this by create branches in Github and then fixing the code inside the IDE along with commenting each of the branches that I had to fix.
